# Week#5 - Bonus B
---
This is the bonus B part of week #5, with the terraform configuration, responsible for building the Weight Tracker application infastructure.
This time not with a VM that we allocated and installed PG on it.
This time it's an azure postgressql db service, a VM they allocate that already has this PG service installed on it.

On Azure Cloud!!
