# Week#5 - Bonus C
---
This is the bonus C part of week #5, with the terraform configuration, responsible for building the Weight Tracker application infastructure.
This time not with webserver VMs that we allocated and installed WTApplication on it.
This time it's a vm scale set that needs to be defined via which  the webserver VMs will be created, along with respective monitoring scaling rules, to determine when to up scale or down scale.

On Azure Cloud!!
